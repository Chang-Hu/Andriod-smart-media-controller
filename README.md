Andriod-smart-media-controller
==============================

Currently, a growing number of people prefer to watch video, listen to music or enjoy other multimedia services from personal computers, due to the huge mass of resources on the Internet. However, a problem arising with the popularization of computer multimedia entertainment is that it is inconvenient to control the computers which are usually placed from a distance when users are in the couch or bed.

In order to solve the problem, we introduce a state-of-art android application, MediaControl, for mobile human- computer interaction, which enables remote control over laptops on media streaming. Users can easily pause or stop a media player, speed the progress, shift to the next, and adjust the volume without having to reach the laptops when they are in couch or bed.

In addition to the basic media remote control system, we also develop several extra functional modules for our application: for example, a gesture steering game to simulate real driving experience by allowing users to drive a virtual car by controlling the mobile device as a steering wheel, and a smart presentation assistant to enable presenters to speak and remotely control lecture slides simultaneously.
